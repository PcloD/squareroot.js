## Log

*Sept 26*
- ~~make the skybox use a ramps instead of colors~~
- ~~add a data/config file~~
- ~~change the bird tail model~~
- ~~create the Bird lib asset, import all~~
- ~~make it fly through the world~~
- ~~implement robust timeline~~

*Backlog*

- make the bird fly on a path (bezier)
- create the particle system (basically adapt gl_dust/dust.html to 3d)

## Script

*S01*
- Screen is black. 
- Grey bird flies into the users face, in the last moment turns left.
- Particle dust falls from his tail.


- Red eye appear at the horizon, then goes away. 
- More eyes popup, moving slightly like wolves.
- The eyes go away, and it starts to get a bit brighter. Just enough to see some contrast.
- Two or three ribbons travel before your eyes. 
- Then a few fishes start to "swim" in the middle, coming from different places
- A stream of particles shoots up in the middle of the fish school, the fishes go away.
- A pyramid builds up (and at the same time the sky becomes mich brighter)
- The sun shows up from behind the pyramid
- The pyramid shoots two more beams of light and a series of lines towards the user.
- The camera moves slowly towards the tip of the pyramid, while the pyramid shoots triangles towards the user. The it rotates slightly ang goes under a sandy terrain.
- The terrain is oscillating and another one comes up that is blue and as if the sand sinks under the water.
- The water comes to a halt.
- A serie of buldings popup on the hemisphere around the user. It's getting a bit darker.
- The brid flys again, this time from behind the user into the buldings.
- The floor becomes like a circular piano keyboard. Each keypress sends a signal on the floor to the building that lights up and pops up a bit.
- The two buldings in the middle collapse and ribbons start to fly over, the a bird and some particles go into the user. 
- One particle is red and it flies right into the eye, all becomes red for a moment, just to fade out to a hellish orange/red/black skybox
- A skull moves in from the bottom and shoots a serie of circles, flashing to white each time.
- From underneath the user we see crack opening. 
- Bubble (transparent particles) start to move slowly up, the sky is dark again.
- A grey terrain appears, a moment of silence. 
- Moon goes up.
- Gradually the light reveals trees. The camera slowly goes up. 
- The eyes can be seen in between the trees.
- White lines come from above.
- Camera shakes, we're being elevated. 
- Faster, thicker lines and rings, until all becomes white and the white floow, blue sky.
- The bird, now blue, flyes over your head in rounds. 
- THE END.

## Ideas for effects

#### Easy
- triangle flying thru
- arc flying thru
- line fly by
- circle switching color
- two-color skybox
- starts on the sky

#### Medium
- oscillating terrain
- eyes in the dark
- canyon

#### High
- pyramid shooting lights
- tail
- fish
