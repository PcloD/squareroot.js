##Post Effects

##What are post effets?

There is a common misconception that post effect are a special/separate feature of WebGL. This is not the case. A post effect is basically a shader applied to a full screen quad (i.e. a plane). 

Typical post effect workflow goes like that:
- render the entire scene to a quad texture
- render the texutre back to the screen applying a shader
