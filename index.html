        <h3>Objective</h3>

        <h5>The North VR Experience is companion piece to the feature film North. It would bring attention and build a fan base for the film, while at the same time, can act as its own standalone piece we can tout to the film, interactive, and advertising communities.</h5>

        <h3>The experience</h3>

        <p>We live in a time where it seems like every week, there’s a new dystopian film at the box office. But rather than create a fictional setting or a fantastical set of rules, I feel that we can look right to our home front. Detroit is a dystopian society within the 21st century. So instead of creating our own world, the film and the VR experience exists within a place that feels more raw and real.</p>

        <p>A Lord of the Flies style story that takes place in a city that we all know. A city that has been lost, but could be found again. As the user puts on the VR device, they are immersed in a dystopian world unlike anything they’ve experienced. It’s decaying, but has a sense of beauty to the decay. Crumbling factories, burnt out homes, abandoned buildings. An atmospheric and ambient music track plays with sound design to augment and highten the narrative.</p>

        <p>Through the North VR experience, I want to explore the theme of looking for something more. The unwavering faith and the unshakeable belief that things will eventually get better. A journey from dystopia to a possible utopia without knowing whether it’s actually out there. I also want to explore the concept of location as a character. Where the geography of a place can be intertwined with story. And where the visuals are as much a part of the story as the characters. It will be an organic documentary style approach, with well-composed beautiful photography.</p>

        <h3>Locations</h3>

        <p>We will tap into the amazing production value of locations in Detroit, similar to the ones used in the film North. We would like to shoot the individual scenes in the most interesting locations both interiors and exteriors around abandoned Detroit buildings and plants.</p>

        <p>While filming the feature film, Matt and filming crew have been location scouting for several weeks. This experience will allow us to make the best choice as to the locations for the VR scenes.</p>

        <h3>Score</h3>

        <p>The feature film is being scored by Chris Walla, guitarist and producer, founder of Death Cab for Cutie. We want to use the score from the film in the VR experience.</p>

        <h3>Ideas</h3>

        <p>The list below presents our ideas and concepts for the execution of the VR experience. We would like to treat them as conversations starters to see what is possible and what will work best.</p>

        <h5>Camera</h5>

        <ul>
            <li>We want to put the public right in the middle of our world, but do so in a way that captivates their attention. This is why, we could place the camera in unexpected places, like hanging mid air in a staircase well, or hidden in the middle of machinery in a plant, watching the characters from hiding. We can also place the camera high up, close to the ceiling, in a class room overlooking the action from above.</li>

            <li>We would like to explore the possibility of the the camera slowly moving throughout the space in some scenes. We understand however the difficulties of moving the camera during the shoot on a rig, so we will plan for both a moving and a static camera setup just in case.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Actors</h5>

        <ul>
            <li>We can introduce actors in the scenes. They could be moving around or performing a specific action, tied to the story, like ex. overcoming an obstacle or moving rubble to unblock a passage.</li>

            <li>They could be writing on the blackboard in a classroom or moving around objects, like books or furniture to reveal something hidden under them. They can also interact with each other, get into and argument, kiss or fight.</li>

            <li>We can shoot a static scene first without any actors, then again with actors in it. By compositing those two takes in post-production, we can achieve a ghosts-like effect of semi-transparent characters.</li> 

            <li>We can film the same actor in many places in a scene and composite this into a single scene where the actor is present in more than one place at the same time.</li>
        </ul>

    </article>

        <h5>Props</h5>

        <ul>
            <li>We could introduce more movement to the otherwise static settings. It could be paper or pages in a book moving in the wind or with air current the we create.</li>

            <li>We can also drop objects from a balconies or into stair wells. This could be paper, foliage or small pieces of wood or glass. This can create an interesting effect as the object flies by the camera or when it lifts dust as it falls on the floor (we would do this only if it's safe for the camera and the crew of course)</li>

            <li>We can also move the furniture or objects in the scene by pulling a thin fishing line attached to them.</li>

        </ul>

        <h5>Light and sound</h5>

        <ul>
            <li>The characters can use flashlights to add light effects in the scenes. This could have a great effect in darker interiors.</li>

            <li>We can introduce elements of interactive sound based on which direction the user is looks into. Ex. if the viewer is looking in the direction the piano in the abandoned lobby, we will hear piano playing in the background.</li>

            <li>We could also cut the voice over in a way that it the narrator could say different things based on what the viewer is looking at. For example: if there is a piece of action that we want the viewer to focus on and she happens to be looking in the opposite direction, the VO can say somdething like "Look behind you..." or "Look on your left..."</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Narration</h5>

        <ul>
            <li>If needed, the experience can be driven by a voice over of one of the characters, narrating the story as we move from one location to the next. The voice over could be poetic and abstract and focus the idea of heading North, to a happier place, to a better place. Or could be more literal and talk about the history of each location, what it once was (i.e. Cadillac plant, Fisher plant...)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>

        <p>We believe that this concept can turn into an exceptional VR experience, that will make us proud of being part of it. Detroit offers a unique setting to tell our story in, and thanks to VR we will be able to submerge the viewers in it, and create an emotional narrative experience.</p>
        
        <p>We would love you to consider supporting this project and help making it a reality.</p>
